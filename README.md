# hiveoscustom



How To:

First create a flight sheet like this: 


Then click on SETUP MINER CONFIG

You can enter %WAL% which takes the wallet info from your hivos config or you can manually enter you wallet in there.  You can also check out if your pool supports worker and put it in there as well.
%WAL%.%WORKER_NAME%

Enter that info with port

I put -G for opencl or you can leave it blank and it picks up defaults.
