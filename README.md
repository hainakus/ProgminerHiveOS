## JRiggs28  HiveOS Progminer-ZANO Custom Miner
** V1.0 - Base Run


This DOES NOT do stats yet but you can start and stop via flight sheet. I plan to get stats going but at least this works.


## How To:

1) Create a flight sheet like this: 
![flightsheet1](minerconfig1.jpg)


2) SETUP MINER CONFIG
![minerconfig](minerconfig.jpg)

- Make sure Miner name is:

progminer-zano

- Enter the installation URL: 

https://github.com/jriggs28/ProgminerHiveOS/raw/master/releases/progminer-zano-1.tar.gz

- Hash Algorithm:

Doesnâ€™t really matter but I set it to progpow

- Wallet & worker template:

You can enter %WAL% which takes the wallet info from your hivos config or you can manually enter you wallet in there.  You can also check out if your pool supports worker and put it in there as well.
%WAL%.%WORKER_NAME%

- Pool URL:

Enter that info with port

- Pass:

Blank

- Extra Config Arguments:

I put -G for opencl or you can leave it blank and it picks up defaults.
